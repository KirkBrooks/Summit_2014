Summit_2014
===========
This is a demonstration database written in v14 of 4th Dimension. It illustrates buidling a calnedar planner using all native 4D objects - no plugins or components required. This is the demo presented at the 2014 4D Summit in San Antonio. 

An implementation of Conway's 'Game of Life' is also included showing how the techniques employed in the planner can be extended to other applications and situations.
